# Effects of Job Training on Wages
This analysis uses linear and logistic regressions to study the effect of a job training program on the wages of male workers in 1978. Findings from this report suggest that training did positively affect wages but the effect was characterized by demographic factors like race and income before the training program.

Please refer to the report for details.
